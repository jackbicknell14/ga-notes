# General Assembly Instructor Training

- Why are we here? What do you want from today? What was a terrible training experience?
- Know your neighbour
- Favourite teacher?

- Expect to know 60% of content everyday
- Know names: What did you bring to the party?
- Tell stories about when things went wrong
- Give options about how problems would be solved, bring in TA experiences
- Project Aristotle by Google - Study on effective teams

## Group work
- Pair programming
- Mini projects, laptop on screen
- Mini teachers
- Live coding
- Crowd source the solution

## Wrap-up
- Post two things learnt and a question into slack channel
- 60/40 instructor student talking split

## Checking for understanding
- Kids want to ask as many questions as possible, adults don't want to ask any
- Now is the time for questions. Instead of 'any questions?'
- Give me five (I want five good answers before we move on)
- Post it notes with CFUs to cycle through
